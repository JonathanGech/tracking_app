## App

The Flutter app (currently supporting Android and iOS) provides tracking mood consisting of a method that helped me a lot with freeing my mind from negativity and getting more clarity.
It includes estimating your current mood, affirmations by writing down things you're greatful about and a diary to write about thoughts keeping your mind busy.

Project's long term goal is not only to offer tracking mood, but to offer tools analysing it in order to prevent mental issues like depressions.

## Short term goals

- [ ] Clean up the codebase
- [ ] Release for Android
- [ ] Release for iOS
